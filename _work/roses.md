text: Dwelling in our mind can sometimes be a challenge. Where do the questions, the repetitive thoughts, the memories, the banal desires, the deep reflections come from? What underlies what goes on in our mind? What influences our thoughts? Through the complex and at the same time so banal mind of Rose, we propose an exercise that encourages introspection. In the course of an examination of the character's consciousness, a series of questions are generated that imply personal and exclusive answers to the spectator.
